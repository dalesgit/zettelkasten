New Monasticism is a modern Christian movement emphasizing communal living, spiritual practices, and social justice, often in urban settings. It draws inspiration from traditional monasticism but adapts its practices to contemporary contexts, emphasizing service, contemplation, and intentional community. 

Key aspects of New Monasticism:

Intentional Community:
New monastics form communities, either within traditional church structures or outside of them, with a shared commitment to a "rule of life". 
Urban Focus:
Unlike traditional monasticism which is often rural, New Monasticism frequently takes root in urban areas, particularly those experiencing social and economic challenges. 
Social Justice:
New monastics are often involved in social justice issues, seeking to address poverty, inequality, and other societal problems. 
Contemplation and Action:
The movement seeks to integrate contemplative practices like prayer and meditation with active engagement in the world. 
Interreligious and Interspiritual:
Some new monastic communities explore connections with other faith traditions and spiritual practices, seeking a more inclusive approach to spirituality. 
Diverse Expressions:
New Monasticism is not a monolithic movement, with various communities developing unique approaches to their shared values.
