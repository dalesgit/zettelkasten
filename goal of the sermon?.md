If we really hear the words of scripture today, we will respond with something like: **wait!** what? I wonder why? I wonder if?"

I say over and over again it's all about the questions. One important question before us today is, "What picture do we have of this God we're trying to pray to?"

Really, it may sound somewhat remote as Abraham engages God in bartering -- as if God was just a drinking buddy. But it's almost proverbial that a very human response to death or a cancer diagnosis is to bargain with God. "If you'll just make the chemo work, I'll be a good ... (*fill in the blank*)" 

God is a drinking buddy? Wait! What?

The disciples say to Jesus in today's reading from [[Luke 11.1-13]]: "Teach us to pray." And he gives them a very simple formula. Not much more than, "God is good, God is great, let us thank him for this food."

Jesus doesn't end with the simple form of prayer, he tells them parables. Jesus' preferred method of teaching is to tell stories. I've thought for a long time we don't take that point seriously enough.

He tells plain stories that his followers can understand. If you have a friend who comes to you with a request, are you going to turn him away? I had a friend send a text to me the other day, asking if I had time to talk. He had just got out of the hospital with a fairly complicated cancer surgery. I'm not gonna blow it off.

Jesus goes on, the land of our God, "Abba", is a land where when you ask for something it will be provided you. *Something like, it's a place where people are provided with what they need, not a place where some are privileged and others will just have to drop by the wayside.*

The God Jesus knows is a God of a loving parent. A parent who loves us at least as much as person who loves us the most. I didn't provide for my children everything they asked for. I tried to provide for them what they needed, what they would need in the time to come, what they didn't even know they needed. 

It's enough to ask: Wait! What is the image of God I set before myself?
