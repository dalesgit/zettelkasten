## When I was growing up

As a child I remember being a fair facsimile of a **first child**. I felt in my gut the expectation that I needed to succeed. I got the message that I was supposed to be like my father, whose name I carried. I took it for granted that I would follow the rules. When given the assignment in kindergarten to color pictures, I thought the number one rule was to stay within the lines.

Around about puberty I began to reject that persona. Slowly at first. Then with more and more purpose I began to discover that going against the grain of the expectations placed on me -- at the very least opened up new possibilities.  Where I had once been a good first born son, I was not becoming an imp. "A mischievous fairy or demon."

It is with that sort of outlook that every time today's lessons would come around -- I preached every 3 years on them -- I would get a bit of a smile -- an impish smile.

Here, after all, was:

1. The version of the Lord's Prayer that was different from the one everyone knew.
2. Jesus' own words that all we have to do is **ask** and God will provide what we ask. Seek and you'll find. I don't know about you, but that has not been my general experience of God. Perhaps with a different perspective? An impish one?
3. Sodom and Gomorrah! That was rich enough. Of course Fr. Agostino gave us a bit of a heads up last week about the lesson in hospitality that it offers us.
4. But excitement of Sodom and Gomorrah came with it the story of Abraham bargaining with God. (When was the last time you had a conversation with God along the lines of, "If I do *such and such* I want you to do *this other thing*." And God responded! And so you kept it up.) It's just so outrageous that it begs for some explanation.
5. The 2<sup>nd</sup> reading is chocked full of intricate and extended metaphors and arguments that it begs for an hour or two lecture to unpack its interwoven meanings.

"Surely there is fun to be had somewhere in all that," has been my general approach on first reading these lessons. 

Today, the single thing that comes through most clearly to me is one little piece of those readings. What is our expectation of who this God is that we pray to? What do we project onto God in the form of expectations? How is our relationship to God affected by the image we have inherited?  #change [[Changing our metaphors]]

## Goal today

If we really hear the words of scripture today, we will respond with something like: **wait!** what? I wonder why? I wonder if?"

I say over and over again it's all about the questions. One important question before us today is, "What picture do we have of this God we're trying to pray to?"

Really, it may sound somewhat remote as Abraham engages God in bartering -- as if God was just a drinking buddy. But it's almost proverbial that a very human response to death or a cancer diagnosis is to bargain with God. "If you'll just make the chemo work, I'll be a good ... (*fill in the blank*)" 

God is a drinking buddy? Wait! What?

The disciples say to Jesus in today's reading from [[Luke 11.1-13]]: "Teach us to pray." And he gives them a very simple formula. Not much more than, "God is good, God is great, let us thank him for this food."

Jesus doesn't end with the simple form of prayer, he tells them parables. Jesus' preferred method of teaching is to tell stories. I've thought for a long time we don't take that point seriously enough.

He tells plain stories that his followers can understand. If you have a friend who comes to you with a request, are you going to turn him away? I had a friend send a text to me the other day, asking if I had time to talk. He had just got out of the hospital with a fairly complicated cancer surgery. I'm not gonna blow it off.

Jesus goes on, the land of our God, "Abba", is a land where when you ask for something it will be provided you. *Something like, it's a place where people are provided with what they need, not a place where some are privileged and others will just have to drop by the wayside.*

The God Jesus knows is a God of a loving parent. A parent who loves us at least as much as person who loves us the most. I didn't provide for my children everything they asked for. I tried to provide for them what they needed, what they would need in the time to come, what they didn't even know they needed. 

It's enough to ask: Wait! What is the image of God I set before myself?

[[preaching]] -- [[Proper 12]] 

### I had imagined it to be something akin to "image of God" cf. [[Linn]]'s in [[linnGoodGoatsHealing1994]].  

> A fully illustrated, full-color book that, through a blending of story, scripture, and theology, tackles questions of sin, hell, and vengeance in such a way that readers are led to transformation and healing in the midst of a loving, merciful, and saving God. (Google Books)

1. Good old Uncle George. Living in a mansion, bearded, gruff and threatening.
2. vengeful, punishing God?
3. Prosecuting attorney or Defense attorney?
4. Meister Eckhart put it this way: The seed of God is in us. Now the seed of a pear tree grows into a pear tree and a hazel seed grows into a hazel tree; a seed of God grows into God.
5. Linns build on "God loves us at least as much as the person who loves us the most."
### Prayer to change us

## Changing us
#conversion #transformation 

It matters what our image of God is, because the image we bring to the relationship will limit the possibilities. One learns quickly in gardening that much depends on the soil, the nutrients, the temperature, the moisture, the light we provide the plants. The difference is between a flourishing -- *whatever it is* -- and a plant that "fails to thrive." 

The names for God that we find in the Bible are rich indeed. "Most high God", "He who is", "The Lord who heals", "The Lord who sanctifies", -- *that just scratches the surface*. But if we imagine God to be a "prosecuting attorney" or "judge", all God's efforts to heal or sanctify us will "fail to thrive".  We will relate to God with defensiveness, with arguments, with stonewalling when what God desires is for us to melt into an embrace of love.

> _Where am I? Who am I?  
How did I come to be here?  
What is this thing called the world?  
How did I come into the world?  
Why was I not consulted?  
And if I am compelled to take part in it, where is the director?  
I want to see him._

_–Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55)_

A song that I used to play on the piano and sing to myself over and over begins this way:

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord \
Open the eyes of my heart \
I want to see You …  

*-- Michael W. Smith*

As I let that music flow in and through me, it became a way to fertilize the budding relationship I sought with God.


## Citizens of the Kingdom

#gods-law #city-of-god 

- St. Augustine
- Abbas and Ammas in the wilderness

When I sought to love my children with all that was within me, I was trying to nurture relationships. My relationship with my children to be sure. But I sought to nurture within them the tools so that they would be able to live in the world around them with grace. I heard just in the past couple of weeks a "meme" that said the **purpose of life** was … (*drum roll*) … to be **kind**. 

> Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you 

… means not the rewarded of an individual person. It means to be rewarded with a web of relationships, beginning with one person and reaching out to include the whole world.
