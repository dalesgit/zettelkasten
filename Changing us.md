It matters what our image of God is, because the image we bring to the relationship will limit the possibilities. One learns quickly in gardening that much depends on the soil, the nutrients, the temperature, the moisture, the light we provide the plants. The difference is between a flourishing -- *whatever it is* -- and a plant that "fails to thrive." 

The names for God that we find in the Bible are rich indeed. "Most high God", "He who is", "The Lord who heals", "The Lord who sanctifies", -- *that just scratches the surface*. But if we imagine God to be a "prosecuting attorney" or "judge", all God's efforts to heal or sanctify us will "fail to thrive".  We will relate to God with defensiveness, with arguments, with stonewalling when what God desires is for us to melt into an embrace of love.

> _Where am I? Who am I?  
How did I come to be here?  
What is this thing called the world?  
How did I come into the world?  
Why was I not consulted?  
And if I am compelled to take part in it, where is the director?  
I want to see him._

_–Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55)_

A song that I used to play on the piano and sing to myself over and over begins this way:

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord \
Open the eyes of my heart \
I want to see You …  

*-- Michael W. Smith*

As I let that music flow in and through me, it became a way to fertilize the budding relationship I sought with God.
