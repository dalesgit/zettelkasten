[[preaching]] -- [[Proper 12]] 

## I had imagined it to be something akin to "image of God" cf. [[Linn]]'s in [[linnGoodGoatsHealing1994]].  

> A fully illustrated, full-color book that, through a blending of story, scripture, and theology, tackles questions of sin, hell, and vengeance in such a way that readers are led to transformation and healing in the midst of a loving, merciful, and saving God. (Google Books)

1. Good old Uncle George. Living in a mansion, bearded, gruff and threatening.
2. vengeful, punishing God?
3. Prosecuting attorney or Defense attorney?
4. Meister Eckhart put it this way: The seed of God is in us. Now the seed of a pear tree grows into a pear tree and a hazel seed grows into a hazel tree; a seed of God grows into God.
5. Linns build on "God loves us at least as much as the person who loves us the most."
