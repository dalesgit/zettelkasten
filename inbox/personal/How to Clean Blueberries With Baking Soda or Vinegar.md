### Key Points

-   Washing blueberries with just water doesn't remove harmful pesticides, bacteria, or mold that can stick to the skin.  
    
-   Soaking blueberries in vinegar or baking soda water helps kill germs and break down pesticide residues.  
    
-   Vinegar and baking soda are safe, cheap, and work better than most store-bought fruit washes.

Blueberries may be small, but they can carry more than just [antioxidants](https://www.marthastewart.com/health-benefits-of-blueberries-8766754)—residues of pesticides, dirt, and bacteria often tag along, too. If you're rinsing them under plain water and calling it a day, it might be time to level up your berry-cleaning game.

While [water alone can remove some debris](https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-wash-blueberries-8671998), food scientist Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., says it's not enough to eliminate pathogens or pesticide residues. For that, household staples like white vinegar or baking soda can be surprisingly effective—and science backs it up. Vinegar’s low pH makes it particularly effective at dissolving certain pesticide residues and inhibiting bacterial growth. Baking soda works a bit differently, neutralizing bacteria through its alkaline nature. But it comes with a catch: a bitter residue if not rinsed thoroughly. Whether you shop at a grocery store or buy from a local farm, knowing the right way to clean blueberries helps keep them safer to eat and extends their shelf life.

## Why Water Isn't Enough

Rinsing blueberries with water might remove dust or loose dirt, but water alone doesn’t do much to eliminate bacteria, mold, or pesticide residues. Both vinegar and baking soda change the pH of the surface of the blueberries, which can also help to extend their shelf life, says Le. This change in pH disrupts microbial growth more effectively than water, which is pH-neutral.

## The Science Behind Vinegar and Baking Soda Washes

**Vinegar**: [White distilled vinegar](https://www.marthastewart.com/vinegar-uses-8350561) is the best choice. It works by creating an acidic environment that breaks down certain pesticides and inhibits bacteria. It's especially effective on pesticides that are basic in pH. The key is the pH—not the specific type of vinegar, Dr. Le explains. So while apple cider vinegar can work, white vinegar is usually cheaper and just as effective.

**Baking soda:** [Baking soda](https://www.marthastewart.com/cleaning-with-baking-soda-8363193) is alkaline and better at tackling different kinds of bacteria. However, it can leave behind a faintly bitter residue if not rinsed thoroughly.

Both vinegar and baking soda are backed by research for removing certain contaminants, though neither is a catch-all solution.12

## DIY Blueberry Cleaning Methods

Here’s how to wash blueberries effectively using ingredients you likely already have:

### Vinegar Wash

1.  Mix 3 parts cold water to 1 part white vinegar in a large bowl.
2.  Add blueberries and let soak for 5 to 10 minutes.
3.  Gently agitate the berries with your hands to help loosen debris.
4.  Drain and rinse thoroughly under cold water to remove any lingering vinegar.
5.  Dry completely on a clean dish towel or paper towels before storing in the refrigerator.  
    

### Baking Soda Wash

1.  Dissolve 1 teaspoon of baking soda in 2 cups of cold water.
2.  Add blueberries and soak for 5 to 10 minutes.
3.  Rinse thoroughly to remove any residue.
4.  Dry completely on a clean dish towel or paper towels before storing in the refrigerator.  
    

Note: Avoid soaking the blueberries for longer than 15 minutes. “The skin can begin to degrade if soaked too long, causing flavors to be dissolved in the cleaning solution,” warns Le.

## Don't Miss

## Should You Buy Commercial Washes?

Many fruit and vegetable washes marketed to consumers aren’t much better than your DIY options. “Only washes used in the industry with very specific peroxide compounds are more effective, but these aren’t available to the general public,” Dr. Le says. So skip the pricey store-bought sprays—your pantry has everything you need.

## When To Wash

-   Wash blueberries just before eating. Moisture left on the skin can accelerate spoilage.
-   Once washed and dried, use them, or if you need to refrigerate them, do so in a breathable container lined with a paper towel.
-   Want to freeze them? Wash, dry thoroughly, and freeze in a single layer before transferring to a bag or container.

### A Food Scientist's Personal Take

Le lives near farms that use regenerative agriculture and admits he rarely washes his blueberries. But for most of us buying from the store or markets, his advice is clear: a short soak in vinegar or baking soda water can help make your blueberries safer and longer-lasting—without changing how they taste.
