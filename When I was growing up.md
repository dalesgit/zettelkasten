As a child I remember being a fair facsimile of a **first child**. I felt in my gut the expectation that I needed to succeed. I got the message that I was supposed to be like my father, whose name I carried. I took it for granted that I would follow the rules. When given the assignment in kindergarten to color pictures, I thought the number one rule was to stay within the lines.

Around about puberty I began to reject that persona. Slowly at first. Then with more and more purpose I began to discover that going against the grain of the expectations placed on me -- at the very least opened up new possibilities.  Where I had once been a good first born son, I was not becoming an imp. "A mischievous fairy or demon."

It is with that sort of outlook that every time today's lessons would come around -- I preached every 3 years on them -- I would get a bit of a smile -- an impish smile.

Here, after all, was:

1. The version of the Lord's Prayer that was different from the one everyone knew.
2. Jesus' own words that all we have to do is **ask** and God will provide what we ask. Seek and you'll find. I don't know about you, but that has not been my general experience of God. Perhaps with a different perspective? An impish one?
3. Sodom and Gomorrah! That was rich enough. Of course Fr. Agostino gave us a bit of a heads up last week about the lesson in hospitality that it offers us.
4. But excitement of Sodom and Gomorrah came with it the story of Abraham bargaining with God. (When was the last time you had a conversation with God along the lines of, "If I do *such and such* I want you to do *this other thing*." And God responded! And so you kept it up.) It's just so outrageous that it begs for some explanation.
5. The 2<sup>nd</sup> reading is chocked full of intricate and extended metaphors and arguments that it begs for an hour or two lecture to unpack its interwoven meanings.

"Surely there is fun to be had somewhere in all that," has been my general approach on first reading these lessons. 

Today, the single thing that comes through most clearly to me is one little piece of those readings. What is our expectation of who this God is that we pray to? What do we project onto God in the form of expectations? How is our relationship to God affected by the image we have inherited?  #change [[Changing our metaphors]]
