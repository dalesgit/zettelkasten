### üìÖ Daily Questions
##### üåú From yesterday I could have done better ‚Ä¶ 
- What to say to people who say that the church needs to get out of politics
#### Great insight:
- at mass, after my reading from Acts 22, [[MP]] said that it put Paul's life-story in a new perspective. He was sent away (by the Spirit?) from Jerusalem:
	- for his own safety?
	- because he couldn't preach the *kerygma* there because of his own history
##### üëé One thing I'm struggling with today is ‚Ä¶
- How to respond in the church, in my life
