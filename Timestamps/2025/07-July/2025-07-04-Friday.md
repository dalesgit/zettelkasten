### 📅 Daily Questions
##### 🌜 Dave asked [[MP]] at the gym
- Are you going to be better off after the passage of Trump's bill. He mentioned that getting rid of taxation on social security earnings would be a big deal for him. (Is that in it?) Why isn't it easy to say to him how life is going to be **immeasurably worse** under the new regime's laws?

##### 🙌 One thing I'm excited about right now is …
- Diana Butler Bass's email and the connections therein. cf. below

##### 🚀 One+ thing I plan to accomplish today is …

# 📝 Notes
- Beginning with [[MP]]'s email from [[Dorothy Butler Bass]], I am stunned with the kindred spirits who are out there and I'm not in touch with. e.g. She and Brian McClaren are doing an annual conference in Georgia:
> Southern Lights Jan 23-25. Each January, Brian McLaren and I host the Southern Lights Conference on St Simons Island, GA. **This year’s theme is: Wisdom From the Edge, When the Center Cannot Hold.** Our speakers include Jemar Tisby, Jennifer Harvey, [[Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer]], and [[Rabbi Or Rose]].
- Trommer has a Ted talk on "[[Changing our metaphors]]" -- which is another way of saying what I imagine to be the theme of my [[Proper 12]] sermon.  
- [[MP]] also forwarding R. Rohr's little note about [[Helder Camara]] that was helpful by providing a list of the things he believed. [[Fwd Richard Rohr’s Daily Meditation A Leading Voice for Liberation - dhath12@gmail.com - Gmail]]
- [[How to type special characters and symbols on a Chromebook]]: particularly ellipsis and fractions.
- One of things I am drawn to I have generally cataloged as "[[thought]]". #thought
