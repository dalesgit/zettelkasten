# 📝 Notes
- Beginning with [[MP]]'s email from [[Dorothy Butler Bass]], I am stunned with the kindred spirits who are out there and I'm not in touch with. e.g. She and Brian McClaren are doing an annual conference in Georgia:
> Southern Lights Jan 23-25. Each January, Brian McLaren and I host the Southern Lights Conference on St Simons Island, GA. **This year’s theme is: Wisdom From the Edge, When the Center Cannot Hold.** Our speakers include Jemar Tisby, Jennifer Harvey, [[Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer]], and [[Rabbi Or Rose]].
- Trommer has a Ted talk on "[[Changing our metaphors]]" -- which is another way of saying what I imagine to be the theme of my [[Proper 12]] sermon.  
- [[MP]] also forwarding R. Rohr's little note about [[Helder Camara]] that was helpful by providing a list of the things he believed. [[Fwd Richard Rohr’s Daily Meditation A Leading Voice for Liberation - dhath12@gmail.com - Gmail]]
