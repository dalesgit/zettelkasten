#liberation 
I would like to say to everyone: 

-   Where \[humanity\] is, the church must be present. 
-   The egoism of the rich presents a more serious problem than Communism.  
-   Today’s world is threatened by the atom bomb of squalid poverty.  
-   Profound changes must be made in order to establish justice in every sphere throughout the world.  
-   Without a deep personal conversion, no one can become an instrument for the conversion of the world….  
-   To revolutionize the world, the only thing needed is for us to live and to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ with real conviction.  
-   Dire poverty is revolting and degrading; it taints the image of God in every \[human\]....
-   My door and my heart are open to all—to all without exception.  
-   Christ has prophesied what will happen at the last judgment: we shall be judged according to the way we have treated him in the persons of the poor, the oppressed, the downtrodden. [^1]
