 It appeared in the conversation yesterday (7/3) with the clergy when I concluded my "address to Peter" when I said that the answer to the multitude of voices and facts the new media throw at us is not to relativise it all, but rather to cultivate [[critical thinking]]. 

Several stories have come my way in the past few days.

- [[Trump's latest cuts to K-12 programs are teaching schoolchildren the wrong lesson]]
	- The Trump administration is teaching American schoolchildren a harsh lesson in strongman politicking with its ongoing assault on the U.S. educational system.
	- shutting down Dept. of Education
	- It's a harmful move that speaks to the president's political incoherence. He's leaving many of America's schoolchildren, and arguably their parents, in a lurch — all in the name of demonizing immigrants and LGBTQ people.
