I didn't know Carl the way most of you did. The reason you all are here is because you can tell the poignant, funny, sad, unexpected, long-forgotten stories about him. I can't do that. I've only been attending St. Alfred's for a couple of years, and I only know Carl from the time that I became aware that there was this tall well-dressed man who sat in the same seat every week. For the most part, when I extended my hand in greeting, he smiled back warmly and kind of nodded.

Seeing him left me feeling something like "there's a man who is secure in his place in the world. He knows who he is and he's ok with that. He know's where he's come from ankd he's ok with that. He knows whose he is and where he's headed and he's ok with that.

I want you to know that every time I saw him -- even more when he smiled and nodded as I shared the peace -- I felt a little better about myself and my own place in the universe.

It was fairly early in my life that I learned about how the trajectory of one's life is, or ought to be, a process of being who you were made to be. That life is made up of not the number of breaths you take but the number of moments that take your breath away. When I saw Carl, I thought of someone who had done well in becoming who he was meant to be.

The silversword plant illustrates the principle.

- [[Silversword story]]

BLOOMS ONCE IN IT'S LIFETIME.... THEN DIES

The Haleakalā silversword, found only on the high slopes of Maui’s Haleakalā volcano is a rare alpine plant that blooms just once in its lifetime. For decades, it waits in silence, its shimmering silver leaves gathering sunlight in the thin mountain air. Then, without warning and only once in its life, it blooms.

According to National Park Service, this event typically occurs after 20 to 50 years though some may flower as early as 7 years depending on environmental conditions. This final act of beauty lasts only about seven days. And then, having poured every ounce of stored energy into reproduction, the plant dies. It’s a symbol of endurance, timing, and the profound rewards of waiting. In a world driven by urgency, it stands as a quiet reminder: some of nature’s most magnificent displays require a lifetime to unfold.

- [[Gilgamesh]] -- oldest human story. It is essentially a reflection on trying to make sense of the death of a human being. What to say?

- [[BCP note on death]]- L. Weil -- whoever it is, whatever the story, it's about [[baptism]], new life, restoration, community (connections)

Funerals above all a [[Sacred]] time when we recognize and celebrate the life of one of the saints who has completed the course of life prepared before he was even born.
