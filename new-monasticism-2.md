New Monasticism is a modern Christian movement that draws inspiration from historical monastic practices to create intentional communities focused on radical discipleship, social justice, and spiritual disciplines. It's not a return to traditional monasteries, but rather a reimagining of monastic ideals within contemporary contexts, often involving lay people and families. 

Here's a more detailed look at New Monasticism:

# Core Principles and Practices:

## Social Justice:

A significant focus is placed on engaging with and serving the marginalized and oppressed, addressing issues of poverty, racism, and injustice. 

## Spiritual Disciplines:

New Monastics practice various spiritual disciplines like prayer, meditation, fasting, and communal worship to cultivate a deeper relationship with God and each other.
