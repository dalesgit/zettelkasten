- Abbas and Ammas in the wilderness

When I sought to love my children with all that was within me, I was trying to nurture relationships. My relationship with my children to be sure. But I sought to nurture within them the tools so that they would be able to live in the world around them with grace. I heard just in the past couple of weeks a "meme" that said the **purpose of life** was … (*drum roll*) … to be **kind**. 

> Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you 

… means not the rewarded of an individual person. It means to be rewarded with a web of relationships, beginning with one person and reaching out to include the whole world.
