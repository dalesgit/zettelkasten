### Psalm 138

Confitebor tibi

1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with my whole heart; *  
before the gods I will sing your praise.

2 I will bow down toward your holy temple  
and praise your Name, *  
because of your love and faithfulness;

3 For you have glorified your Name *  
and your word above all things.

4 When I called, you answered me; *  
you increased my strength within me.

5 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Lord, *  
when they have heard the words of your mouth.

6 They will sing of the ways of the Lord, *  
that great is the glory of the Lord.

7 Though the Lord be high, he cares for the lowly; *  
he perceives the haughty from afar.

8 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me safe; *  
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;  
your right hand shall save me.

9 The Lord will make good his purpose for me; *  
O Lord, your love endures for ever;  
do not abandon the works of your hands.
